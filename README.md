# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

This is an Amazon-like storefront app created with the MySQL skills, node js and javascript skills. This simple app takes in orders from customers and depletes the stock from the store's inventory. 

Please find a link to a video that explains how this works.


## Basic Functionality 

The javascript file runs in nodejs and allows the user to view the current inventory of store items and their details such as: item IDs, descriptions, department in which the item is located and price. 

The user is then able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. If the selected quantity is currently in stock, the user's order is placed, displaying the total purchase price and updating the store database. If the desired quantity is not available, the user is prompted to change their order.
